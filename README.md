# Graph Recreations
In this project, I was tasked with taking some graphs that did not follow the best visualization practices such as being too busy, misleading the audience in some way or just
not being nice to look at, and recreate them to be more understandable and easy to read. I have include the Python script where I made all of the changes and explain the alterations
I made and why, and also a document where you can compare the original graph with the ones I have created. 

# Packages
The packages used in the script were pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn.
To ensure that the code will run, these packages need to be installed:
- pandas from PyPi
- Numpy already comes with Python
- matplotlib
- seaborn
